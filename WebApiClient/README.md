# Yuri WebAPIClient

## Server Side

First of all, you need to set a request token in the bots `config.json` like in the following example:
```json
{
   "wstoken": "RjmdFcLG62LKXTjDJSgAgYqxX7Nvq7xGJ3LekqtGZD7gDn43GTTa2T7t2uhBF9RG",
}
```
A nice site to generate such tokens is [passwordsgenerator.net](http://passwordsgenerator.net/).

Then, if you host your bot on an private home server *(for example a Raspberry Pi or somethign like that)*, you need to forward the port **`6612`** *(or whatever else port if you had changed it in the websocket.js class)* in your router / gateway.

If everything went successfull, you will see that the websocket is starting right before the Discord client is loggs in:

## Client Side

Just [download](https://github.com/zekroTJA/yuri/releases) the lastest version of the tool and save it somewhere on your PC or compile it by yourself. You'll need Visual Stuido 2015+ for this.

Also, don't forget to place the `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` right next to the file.

Then, just start the tool, enter your API adress (defaultly `http://yourserversip:6612`) and your token you've set in the config.
After, klick on `Login`.

Then, you can chose one of the guilds the bot is connected to. There you should obviously use the guild you are currently talking on.

Also very important is that the bot is still connected to your voice channel! Otherwise nothing will happen, because the API needs to find the player instance for the set guild.

Then, just define some key combinations with some sounds.

**Attention:**  
These are global hotkeys! That means, that they *could* overwrite some hot key of games orprograms, so chose them carefully!
